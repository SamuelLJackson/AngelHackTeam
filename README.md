# Mineable Oracle Token

<b>Project MOTPOW</b> is an oracle schema that implements a mineable proof of work competiton to determine the validity of data outside of the blockchain.  This project leverages EIP918's Oracle Token as a standard that uses a SHA-256 Proof of Work algorithm for token minting and distribution.  MOTPOW implements a game theoretical competition in order to disintermediate the 3rd party trust layer associated with centralized oracle services like Oraclize, use basic API getters to provide smart-contracts with off-chain data.


By creating an oracle schema that uses a sound game-theoretical construct to determine the validity of off-chain data, we:
  1. <b>Remove</b>
  2. <b>Enable</b>
  3. <b>Create</b>
